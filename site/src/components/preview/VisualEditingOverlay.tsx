// Studio-driven navigation (the navigator side panel, document locations, the

// preview page here is its own server-rendered document, so the URL changed
// while the page never did (bit the hub navigator on day one, 2026-08-24).
// An MPA adapter instead: any push/replace to a different URL is a REAL load.
// Module-level so the overlay never resubscribes on re-render.
//
// TWO NOTES ON THE HOST, both read out of the pinned sources (2026-08-28):
//
//  - `subscribe` REPORTS. The host's History.tsx posts whatever we hand the
//    callback as `visual-editing/navigate`, and Presentation treats a reported
//    url that differs from its own bookkeeping as "the frame moved here" and
//    rewrites `params.preview` to match. So this report is not decorative: it
//    is the frame's statement of where it is, and it must be exact.
//  - Presentation DROPS a navigation asked for while its overlay channel is not
//    connected, while still recording the target as though it had been made.
//    Nothing in the frame can recover that; the Studio side has to ask again.
//    See src/lib/preview-navigation.ts, which is where that retry lives.

// VisualEditingOverlay — click-to-edit overlay + refresh for the preview
// =============================================================================
// Three jobs, all only ever active in the Studio's Presentation preview (this
// is rendered from PreviewLayout with client:only when draftMode is true, so it
// never ships to a public page):
//
//  1. `<VisualEditing>` draws the click-to-edit overlay and opens the comlink
//     to the parent Studio window.
//  2. REFRESH: the section content is server-rendered Astro, so we can't
//     re-render it on the client the way a React app would. Instead we soft-
//     refetch THIS preview URL and RECONCILE the fresh <main> into the live one
//     — no full reload, no scroll jump, and click-to-edit keeps working because
//     the refetched HTML is draft-fetched with stega too. Triggers:
//
//     a. AUTO: an EventSource on /preview/live (see src/pages/preview/live.ts).
//        The Worker holds the Sanity token and proxies the listen API's
//        mutation events — already filtered to docs that can affect this page —
//        into tiny "change" signals. Event-driven on purpose: one long-lived
//        request per preview session instead of the 1.5s /preview/refresh-signal
//        poll this replaced (2026-07-14, commit 719650f), which burned thousands
//        of uncached Sanity API requests per editing session. Never reintroduce
//        an interval poll here.
//     b. MANUAL: the comlink `refresh` handler — the preview's Refresh (⟳)
//        button (`source: 'manual'`), kept as the fallback if the stream is
//        down, and the `source: 'mutation'` edit event IF the Studio ever
//        sends it again (deprecated, silent in Sanity 6.x).
//
//     Both triggers go through the SCHEDULER in src/lib/preview-refresh.ts:
//     single-flight, stale-response discard, and a floor on the interval
//     between renders. Read that file before you touch anything below — it is
//     where the six-concurrent-renders `Error 1102` and the reverting-text bug
//     are written up. HOW the fresh HTML lands is src/lib/preview-morph.ts: an
//     in-place morph, never a wholesale swap. That file has the measurements;
//     the short version is that replacing <main> re-decoded every image on the
//     page and blocked the main thread for about a second, twice per keystroke.
//  3. INSTANT TEXT (`useInstantText`, 2026-08-28): the refresh above is the
//     COMPLETE answer, and it is not the FAST one. Plain strings are swapped
//     into the page the moment the edit reaches the frame, which is well before
//     the server can re-render it. See ./overlay/useInstantText.ts for what it
//     will and will not touch, and why it re-applies itself after each refresh.
//     It is ALSO a change event for the scheduler above (`noteInstantChange`):
//     the document it just applied is the newest one anybody knows about, so
//     any render started before it is stale even though no SSE signal has
//     arrived for it yet.
//
// This deliberately does NOT re-render the whole page per keystroke: that would
// require porting the Astro section renderer to React, recreating the two-
// renderers drift the page builder exists to avoid. See docs/PAGE_BUILDER.md.
//
// TIMING. Set `localStorage.previewTiming = '1'` in the preview frame to have
// both paths log how long they took. See ./overlay/timing.ts.

  // grace, with structural edits unrendered. The extra bumps cost no extra
  // renders — single flight plus the rate limit cap STARTS at one per
  // REFRESH_MIN_INTERVAL_MS however many changes arrive between them — they
  // only move renders from "accepted with stale words" to "discarded, retried".

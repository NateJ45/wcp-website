// =============================================================================
// useInstantText — typed words appear on the page, not a second and a half later
// (2026-08-28)
// =============================================================================
// THE OLD LOOP, end to end: type in the Studio → Studio autosave commits →
// Sanity indexes the change → our Worker's /preview/live listen fires →
// EventSource → debounce → refetch this preview URL on the server → swap <main>.
// Every hop is small; together they were 1.5–3 seconds, and the editor spent
// them watching a page that still said the old thing.
//
// THE SHORT PATH THIS ADDS. The frame already holds a live copy of the draft
// document. `<VisualEditing>` starts an optimistic-document actor whose remote
// feed is not Sanity but the STUDIO ITSELF: the Studio runs its own listen with
// `visibility: "transaction"` and relays every mutation over the comlink
// (`presentation/snapshot-event`), where a mendoza patch is applied to the
// in-memory document. So the frame learns about an edit as soon as the
// transaction lands — before the query index has caught up, which is what the
// server refetch has to wait for.
//
// So: watch the actor, diff the document against the last one we saw, and for
// every PLAIN STRING that changed, write the new characters straight into the
// text nodes showing it. The refetch still happens; it just stops being the
// thing anyone waits for.
//
// AND A SECOND, SHORTER PATH (2026-08-28). The swap above costs about 4ms; the
// wait that was left is all upstream of it, because the actor's feed is still a
// LISTEN — the edit is autosaved, committed and made visible before the frame
// hears a word. The Studio has the answer a whole round trip earlier, in the
// local document store its form writes optimistic patches into, so the Studio
// side now posts that draft straight across (same origin, `postMessage`) as the
// editor types. Both sources land in the SAME diff-and-swap below; which one may
// write, and why a stale actor snapshot must not, is decided by `acceptsSource`
// in src/lib/preview-live-draft.ts. The Studio end is
// src/sanity/components/LiveDraftBridge.tsx.
//
// Messages from that channel are treated as hostile until proven otherwise: this
// is a public bundle, `message` is a public doorway, and `parseLiveDraft` drops
// anything that is not exactly the agreed shape without a word.
//
// EXACTLY THREE THINGS MAKE THIS SAFE TO POINT AT A LIVE PAGE, and all three
// live in tested pure helpers rather than here:
//
//   1. src/lib/preview-text-diff.ts reports only plain string leaves, only when
//      both sides are strings, and never inside portable text.
//   2. src/lib/preview-stega.ts decodes the invisible payload every preview
//      string carries, so a field is matched to its text node by identity rather
//      than by searching the page for the old words.
//   3. src/lib/preview-text-nodes.ts writes only into a node whose visible
//      characters are EXACTLY the old value, and re-attaches the payload it split
//      off. Nothing degrades: click-to-edit on a node this touched still resolves
//      to the same field, because the node keeps the same stega it arrived with.
//
// WHAT IT DOES NOT DO, on purpose: portable text and the rich twins, anything
// whose rendering transforms the value (an accented heading, a truncated card
// blurb, a joined list), and anything that changes the SHAPE of the page — a new
// section, a reorder, a toggled block. All of those are left to the soft
// refresh, which renders them correctly a moment later. A missed instant update
// is invisible. A wrong one would be the preview lying about the page.
//
// THE ONE ORDERING HAZARD, and the TWO things that handle it. The soft refresh
// reconciles server-rendered HTML into <main>, and that HTML can be OLDER than
// what this already wrote, because the server reads the query index and neither
// channel above waits for it.
//
//   FIRST, IT SHOULD NOT LAND AT ALL. Every document applied here bumps the
//   refresh scheduler's change sequence (the `onDocument` callback the overlay
//   passes in), so a render that started before it is discarded on arrival
//   rather than morphed in. Before that bump the sequence moved only on the SSE
//   change events — Sanity's transaction visibility, a second behind the
//   keystroke — so a render begun mid-burst looked current when it landed and
//   wrote a HALF-TYPED sentence over the finished one. That was the editor's
//   "half my text disappears, then a second later it comes back".
//
//   SECOND, IF ONE LANDS ANYWAY. Every swap this makes is remembered, and after
//   each refresh the pending ones are re-applied to the fresh DOM — and dropped
//   as soon as the server's own HTML says the same thing. The re-apply matches
//   any value the field has passed through this session, not only the one the
//   burst started from, precisely because an intermediate is what a mid-burst
//   render carries. (The other half of that
// reasoning lives in src/pages/preview/live.ts: the listen there must keep
// `visibility: "query"`, because a faster signal would trigger a refetch of
// data that is still stale, and stale HTML is exactly what this has to undo.)

// =============================================================================
// LiveDraftBridge — the Studio's local edits, posted to the preview as they type
// (2026-08-28)
// =============================================================================
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES. The preview already swaps changed plain strings into the
// page the instant an edit reaches it, and the swap costs about 4ms. But the
// frame only LEARNS about an edit through the optimistic actor, whose feed is
// the Studio's `client.listen`: the edit has to be autosaved, committed and made
// visible as a transaction first. That round trip is the 1–2 seconds an editor
// still watches, and it is not a bug anyone can tune away — it is what "the
// server knows about it now" costs.
//
// The Studio knows a whole round trip earlier. `useEditState` reads the LOCAL
// document store, whose `draft` snapshot is rebuilt from optimistic patches as
// the editor types, before anything is sent. This component watches that
// snapshot and posts it straight into the preview iframe, which is same-origin
// with the Studio. The listen-driven path keeps running underneath and
// reconciles exactly as before; it simply stops being the thing anyone waits for.
//
// FOUR THINGS KEEP THIS FROM BEING A LIABILITY:
//
//  - It renders NULL and holds no state of its own. Mounted from the navigator,
//    which already resolves which page the preview is showing, and unmounted the
//    moment that resolution goes away. This repo builds TWO navigators from one
//    factory (public `page` rows, Family Hub `hubPage` rows), so both flavors
//    mount this and `documentType` follows the row. The hub side is safe: the
//    post never leaves the browser, and the hub preview route keeps its own
//    cookie gate.
//  - DEFAULT priority, deliberately not `'low'`. The Studio's own
//    PostMessageRefreshMutations asks for `'low'` because it only needs to
//    know THAT a document changed, eventually; we need to know WHAT it says,
//    now. Measured live 2026-08-28: under `'low'` the store coalesced
//    isolated keystrokes into the autosave commit, so one keystroke reached
//    the preview in 413ms and the next in 1429ms - the editor's "still a
//    second or two". The trailing throttle below, not the store's
//    scheduler, is what keeps this cheap.
//  - THROTTLED, TRAILING. A keystroke is one snapshot; a burst is one post.
//  - It never throws. A missing iframe, a cross-origin one, a frame that has
//    navigated away mid-post: all of it is swallowed, because failing here must
//    cost the editor nothing more than the old, slower path.
//
// THE MESSAGE, and why the receiving end distrusts it, live in
// src/lib/preview-live-draft.ts. `document: null` is sent on purpose when the
// page has no draft, so the island can tell "nothing to say" apart from silence.
// =============================================================================

// FORKED from ncs-astro-sanity-starter (PORTS.md card 36, 2026-09-06). The
// canonical copy is still the starter's; this repo's differs by its icon import
// alone, because it resolves @sanity/icons 5.2.1 while the starter and every
// other site are on 3.8.0, and the 5.x barrel no longer re-exports each icon.
// The marker is deliberately absent so sync-check does not report a drift
// nobody can fix from either side. Re-mark this file when the starter moves to
// icons 5, and take the starter's copy at that point.
// =============================================================================
// shareDraftLink - "Copy share link": show an outside reviewer the DRAFT
// =============================================================================
// The problem this solves. An editor has a page half-rewritten and wants the
// board chair to read it before it goes live. Today the only honest answers are
// "publish it and hope" or "make them a Sanity account". Neither is what they
// asked for.
//
// The mechanism is the one the Presentation tool already uses. Its preview
// iframe reaches /api/draft-mode/enable carrying a one-time secret minted by
// @sanity/preview-url-secret; the endpoint validates the secret against the
// dataset and, only then, sets the perspective cookie that makes every
// /preview/* route render drafts. Nothing about that handshake requires the
// visitor to be logged in to Sanity: it requires the SECRET, which only the
// Studio can mint. So a share link is simply the same URL, minted on demand and
// handed to a human instead of to an iframe.
//
//   /api/draft-mode/enable
//     ?sanity-preview-secret=<minted>
//     &sanity-preview-pathname=/preview/<page>
//
// The endpoint is untouched by this feature and still fails closed: an invalid,
// tampered, or expired secret gets a bare 401 and no cookie.
//
// THE TTL IS ONE HOUR AND CANNOT BE EXTENDED.
// createPreviewSecret() stamps the secret document, and validateSecret() only
// accepts one whose _updatedAt is within SECRET_TTL of now. SECRET_TTL is a
// hard-coded `60 * 60` in @sanity/preview-url-secret/constants; there is no ttl
// option on the create call and no way to widen the validating query, which
// lives inside the package. So the UI says "about an hour" out loud rather than
// letting a reviewer discover it as a 401 tomorrow morning. Minting a fresh
// link is one click, which is the intended answer to an expired one.
//
// (The package also carries a "shared access" singleton with a non-expiring
// secret, toggled by toggle-preview-access-sharing. It is deliberately NOT used
// here: it turns draft preview on for anyone who ever saw any link, forever,
// with no per-link revocation. A one-hour link that an editor re-mints is the
// safer default for a volunteer-run site.)
//
// HTTPS ONLY, on purpose. The enable endpoint sets its cookie with
// `secure: true; sameSite: none` because Presentation loads it cross-context.
// A browser will not store that cookie over plain http, so a share link works
// on the deployed site and not against `http://localhost:4321`. Test share
// links on the deployed origin.
//
// Two surfaces use this module. The document action below is registered in
// sanity.config.ts in every repo, so the link is one click from the edit panel
// and from the desk. Repos that also ship a Presentation page navigator
// (PreviewNavigator.tsx) put a per-row button on it through the same hook.

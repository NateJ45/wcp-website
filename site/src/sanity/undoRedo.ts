// =============================================================================
// Document-level undo and redo (PORTS.md card 27)
// =============================================================================
// THE PROBLEM. Ctrl+Z inside a text box undoes typing, because the browser owns
// that. Everything else an editor does - add a section, drag a section, pick a
// different background, clear a photo - has no undo at all. Squarespace has
// one. The honest answer up to now was "open Version history and restore",
// which is a five-click detour for a mis-drag.
//
// THE MECHANISM. Every mutation Sanity accepts is written to a transaction log,
// and each entry carries a mendoza patch in BOTH directions:
//
//   GET /data/history/<dataset>/transactions/<documentId>
//       ?effectFormat=mendoza&excludeContent=true&excludeMutations=true
//       &includeIdentifiedDocumentsOnly=true&reverse=true&limit=<n>
//
// NDJSON, newest first, one transaction per line, each with
// `effects: { <docId>: { apply: [...], revert: [...] } }`. Apply the `revert`
// patch to the document as it stands and you have the document as it was; apply
// `apply` to that and you are forward again. This is the same request the
// Studio's own Version history makes (sanity's Timeline fetches with exactly
// these parameters), so it needs no extra permission and no extra token.
//
// THREE THINGS THAT ARE NOT OBVIOUS, all verified against a live dataset on
// 2026-08-28 before a line of this was written:
//
//   1. `excludeContent=false` is REFUSED. The API answers 403
//      "This API requires excludeContent to be true". The effects come back
//      anyway - excludeContent drops the mutation payloads, not the effects.
//   2. A transaction's `id` IS the `_rev` the document carries afterwards.
//      That is the whole rev guard: if the newest transaction's id is not the
//      document's current `_rev`, something landed that we cannot see, so we
//      do nothing.
//   3. `_rev` MUST be stripped before applyPatch. It is not part of the value
//      the effects were computed against, and leaving it on shifts every field
//      index in the patch - the document comes back with `_type` reading
//      "homePage3:54" and a paragraph turned into an array of letters. Sanity's
//      own applyMendozaPatch does the same strip; this is not a nicety.
//
// SAFETY. Only the DRAFT id is ever read or written, which makes this
// inherently publish-safe: a publish is a mutation on the published twin, so it
// is not in this log and cannot be undone here. The rev guard refuses rather
// than clobbering a concurrent edit. Nothing is deleted except a draft whose
// published twin still exists, and that is checked first. Every call goes
// through the Studio session's own client, so the server enforces permissions.
//
// WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not version history. It reaches back only as far as
// this session's own steps plus the last few transactions, it forgets
// everything on reload, and it never touches published content. Version history
// remains the deep restore, and the guide says so.

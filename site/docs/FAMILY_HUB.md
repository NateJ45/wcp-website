# Family Hub — how the gate works & how to run it

The Family Hub (`/family-hub/**`) is the private, enrolled-families-only area. Unlike
the marketing pages (which are static HTML built ahead of time), every hub page is
**server-rendered on each request** so it can (a) check you're signed in and (b) read
private content that must never sit in the public site or in git.

> ⚠️ **TEMPORARY — the gate is currently OPEN for private preview.** `src/middleware.ts`
> has `const HUB_OPEN = true`, which bypasses the sign-in check so the hub can be previewed
> without a password while the site isn't public and there is no real family data in Sanity.
> **Set `HUB_OPEN = false` and redeploy before launch, or before ANY real family PII
> (directory, health) is entered in the Studio.** Everything below describes the gate as it
> works when `HUB_OPEN` is `false`.

## How the gate works

1. **Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`) runs on every request to a `/family-hub/*` page.
   If you have no valid session it redirects you to `/family-hub/login`, remembering
   where you were headed (`?to=…`) so you land there after signing in.
2. **Login** (`/family-hub/login`) takes the one shared family password and POSTs it to
   `/api/hub-login`, which compares it (constant-time) to the `FAMILY_HUB_PASSWORD`
   secret. On a match it sets a signed, `HttpOnly` session cookie and sends you on.
3. **Sign out** posts to `/api/hub-logout`, which destroys the session.

The password is a **single shared password for the whole school**, rotated each year —
not a per-family login. That matches the old Squarespace hub and keeps it simple for a
volunteer board.

## The hub shell

Every `/family-hub/*` page renders inside `HubShell` → `BaseLayout chrome="hub"`, which
draws the hub's persistent chrome:

- **Desktop (≥ `lg`):** a sticky left navigation **rail** (`HubRail.astro`), built from the
  single grouped nav config in `src/data/hub-nav.ts` — Home, News & Events, Resources,
  Money, Community, Classes — with the active page highlighted, a light/dark `ThemeToggle`,
  and Sign out.
- **Mobile (< `lg`):** a top bar (`HubTopBar.astro`, the page title + menu button) that opens
  the same nav as a slide-in **drawer** (`HubRail` rendered a second time as the drawer's
  contents). `src/scripts/hub-drawer.ts` handles open/close, a focus trap, Esc-to-close, a
  backdrop tap, and body-scroll lock — progressive enhancement over inert markup already in
  the DOM.

Sign out still posts to `/api/hub-logout` (unchanged). The rail is a fixed navy "island" —
it looks the same in light and dark mode, unlike the marketing pages' theme-reactive
surfaces — so its colors are hardcoded rather than pulled from the `--color-*-ink` tokens
(those flip to the bright brand tier in dark mode for text-on-dark-page use, which would
undo the AA contrast fix on a fixed fill; see the comment in `HubRail.astro`).

## One-time setup (before the first deploy)

Run these from the `site/` folder. You only do this once.

```sh
# 1. Create the KV namespace that stores sessions, then paste the printed id
#    into wrangler.jsonc under kv_namespaces → "id".
npx wrangler kv namespace create SESSION

# 2. Set this year's family password as a Cloudflare secret (you'll be prompted
#    to type it — it is never stored in git).
npx wrangler secret put FAMILY_HUB_PASSWORD
```

That's it for the gate. Deploy as usual with `npm run deploy`.

## Rotating the password (each school year)

```sh
npx wrangler secret put FAMILY_HUB_PASSWORD   # type the new one
```

Existing sessions keep working until they expire or the person signs out; new sign-ins
require the new password. Email the new password to families in the welcome message.

## Local development

- `.dev.vars` (git-ignored) holds a throwaway dev password: `FAMILY_HUB_PASSWORD="wcp-test-2026"`.
- `npm run dev`, then visit http://localhost:4321/family-hub — you'll be bounced to the
  login page; sign in with the dev password to get through.
- `.dev.vars.example` is the committed template showing what to put in `.dev.vars`.

## Where the private content lives

Hub page content (calendar, documents, directory, health, finances, per-class info) is
**not** in this repo. It lives in **Sanity**, read at request time behind this gate with
a server-only token. That keeps real family names, addresses, health and financial
details out of the public GitHub repo entirely.

## Section pages — current status

All twelve section pages are **built with their real layouts** from the current live hub
(tuition rates + pay buttons, the document library, class facts, co-op role descriptions,
health/illness policy, event-type legend, and so on), and every page's heading, intro, and
body sections are Board-editable through the page-builder (see "Editing hub pages" below).
Each page's live/private data reads from Sanity behind the gate:

| Section                       | Live data source                                                         |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Calendar                      | Google Calendar (set `googleCalendarId` in Site Settings; click-to-load) |
| Fundraising                   | `campaign` docs (Treasurer updates the raised amount in the Studio)      |
| Updates                       | `update` docs (the migrated meeting blog)                                |
| Documents                     | `hubDocument` docs                                                       |
| Co-op Jobs                    | `coopRole` docs (+ live assignment)                                      |
| Classes                       | `class` docs (facts + tuition button) + `classNote` docs                 |
| Tuition                       | `class` docs (rates + PayPal button) + the `feeSchedule` singleton       |
| Directory, Health (per-child) | `directoryEntry` docs / per-child info — opt-in PII, gated only          |

Where a data source is empty, the page shows a designed empty-state that names its source.
Fallback layout content lives in typed data files under `src/data/hub/` and
`src/data/classes.ts`, so a fixed widget always renders. Nothing in those files is PII (no
family or board-member names, addresses, phones, or finances).

## Updates / meeting blog

The **Updates** section is the meeting blog, migrated in full from the old Squarespace
`/blog` ("School Updates"). Each post is a Sanity `update` doc with `title`, `slug`,
`excerpt`, optional `image` (a flyer/graphic), `publishedAt`, `audience`, and a full
`blockContent` `body` (rich text preserved as Portable Text). The index
(`/family-hub/updates`) lists posts as cards; each links to its own gated page
(`/family-hub/updates/[slug].astro`, SSR) that renders the body in full via
`renderPortableText`.

Re-run the one-time import any time with `node scripts/migrate-hub-updates.mjs` — it reads
the Squarespace JSON view (`/blog?format=json`), converts each post's HTML body to Portable
Text, uploads inline flyer images, and `createOrReplace`s `hubUpdate-<slug>` docs
(idempotent). Going forward the Board just adds `update` docs in the Studio.

## Directory & map

The **Directory** reads opted-in `directoryEntry` docs (PII, gated), sorted
alphabetically by `familyName` (the surname). Every family is **fully editable in Studio →
Family Hub → Directory**: family name, each parent (name + their own email + phone), each
child (name + class), a family photo, the home address, the map pin, notes, and a "Show in
directory" toggle. Adding a new family = create a `directoryEntry` and turn on "Show in
directory". It has a **List / Map toggle**: the map is Leaflet + OpenStreetMap (no API key,
no third-party tracker), plotting each family's home pin relative to the school (the ★). The
whole map is behind the gate, so plotting home locations is fine here — it never touches the
public site.

The current 2026-27 families were loaded from the old Squarespace directory code block with
`node scripts/migrate-directory.mjs` — it parses `wcp-directory-block.html` (a gitignored PII
file), uploads each family photo to Sanity, and `createOrReplace`s `directoryEntry-<surname>`
docs (idempotent; a `.dir-photos.json` cache avoids re-uploading). **This is real family PII
and never enters git** — it lives only in the gated Sanity dataset. Going forward the Board
adds/edits families directly in the Studio.

A family's pin comes from its `location` (a geopoint; the migration set it from the block's
saved coordinates). For a family added later, a volunteer just types the home `address` and
runs `node scripts/geocode-directory.mjs`, which geocodes any address with no pin yet (via
free Nominatim, rate-limited to 1/sec) and writes back the `location`. It's idempotent, so it
only touches new/changed addresses. The school's own pin is a fixed constant in
`DirectoryMap.astro`.

## Editing hub pages (the hub page-builder)

Every hub page is built on the **page-builder**, so volunteers edit them in the
Studio like the public pages. Each page reads a **`hubPage`** doc (by a fixed
`hubKey`) at request time behind the gate: an editable **heading**, **intro**, and a stack
of **sections** from the hub-safe palette (`HUB_SECTION_TYPE_NAMES` — content sections only;
the build-time "pull" sections can't run behind the gate). The page's **fixed widget**
(per-child health info, calendar embed, PayPal buttons, directory map, live campaign bars,
class facts) stays locked in code and the editable sections wrap around it. If no `hubPage`
doc exists for a key, the page shows its built-in fallback content, so it can never go blank.

Edit them in **Studio → Family Hub → Hub pages**. Seed a page's starting content with
`node scripts/migrate-hub-pages.mjs` (idempotent, `hubPage-<key>` ids).

**All hub pages are converted:** Landing (`home`), Calendar, Co-op Jobs, Documents, Tuition,
Updates, Fundraising, Health, Directory, and the four class pages (`twos`, `threes`,
`pre-k-am`, `pre-k-pm`). Each reads its `hubPage` doc for an editable heading, intro, and a
stack of hub-safe sections, wrapped around a **fixed widget** that stays locked in code:

| Hub page    | Fixed widget (locked)                              | Already editable elsewhere                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Landing     | Quick-link nav grids                               | —                                                  |
| Calendar    | Click-to-load Google Calendar embed + event legend | `googleCalendarId` in Site Settings                |
| Co-op Jobs  | Assignment widget + role descriptions + org chart  | `coopRole` docs                                    |
| Documents   | Document library + required-forms callout          | `hubDocument` docs                                 |
| Tuition     | Pay-card + fee-card layout, payment FAQ            | `class` docs + `feeSchedule` (rates, buttons, FAQ) |
| Updates     | Meeting-blog post list                             | `update` docs                                      |
| Fundraising | Live campaign progress bars                        | `campaign` docs                                    |
| Health      | Per-child health info (PII)                        | (per-child, gated)                                 |
| Directory   | Opt-in family cards + map + privacy framing        | `directoryEntry` docs                              |
| Class pages | Fact-card + pay-button layout, class notes         | `class` docs (facts, button) + `classNote` docs    |

Only the widget **layout** stays in code. All of its content is Board-editable through its own
doc type: class facts, tuition rates, and PayPal button ids live in the `class` docs and the
`feeSchedule` singleton; documents, class notes, campaigns, co-op roles, and family cards each
have their own docs. A mistyped icon name from any of these is guarded by `safeIcon`, so it
can never crash a page. Everything on every hub page is now Board-editable.
